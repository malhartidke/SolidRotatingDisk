 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.858   TIME= 11:30:15
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =      10.218   TIME= 11:30:24
 Element 7969 (type = 1, PLANE183) (and maybe other elements) has become 
 highly distorted.  Excessive distortion of elements is usually a        
 symptom indicating the need for corrective action elsewhere.  Try       
 incrementing the load more slowly (increase the number of substeps or   
 decrease the time step size).  You may need to improve your mesh to     
 obtain elements with better aspect ratios.  Also consider the behavior  
 of materials, contact pairs, and/or constraint equations.  Please rule  
 out other root causes of this failure before attempting rezoning or     
 nonlinear adaptive solutions.  If this message appears in the first     
 iteration of first substep, be sure to perform element shape checking.

 Axisymmetric element 992 has deformed so that one or more integration   
 points have crossed the centerline.  It is suggested that you apply     
 the load more slowly, or possibly consider rezoning.

 Axisymmetric element 7970 has deformed so that one or more integration  
 points have crossed the centerline.  It is suggested that you apply     
 the load more slowly, or possibly consider rezoning.                    

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =      15.725   TIME= 11:30:30
 Element 7970 (PLANE183) is turning inside out.
